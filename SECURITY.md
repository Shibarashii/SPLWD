## üîê Security Measures

### Data Protection

#### Student Privacy (FERPA Compliance)
- **Encrypted Storage**: All student data is encrypted at rest
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging**: All data access is logged and monitored
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Secure Password Policies**: Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Available for administrator accounts
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks

#### Database Security
- **Prepared Statements**: All queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- **Database Encryption**: Sensitive fields are encrypted using AES-256
- **Connection Security**: SSL/TLS encryption for database connections
- **Regular Backups**: Encrypted backups with secure storage

#### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: XSS prevention through proper output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery tokens on all forms
- **File Upload Security**: Strict file type validation and scanning

### Infrastructure Security

#### Server Security
- **Regular Updates**: Operating system and software patches
- **Firewall Configuration**: Restrictive firewall rules
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitoring for suspicious activities
- **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS encryption for all communications

#### Environment Security
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration in .env files
- **Secret Management**: Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- **Code Repository**: No sensitive data in version control
- **Deployment Security**: Secure deployment processes

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning

We regularly perform:
- **Static Code Analysis**: Automated code security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Third-party library vulnerability checks
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Automated SQL injection detection
- **XSS Testing**: Cross-site scripting vulnerability scanning

### Manual Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Access Control Testing**: Role and permission verification
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Tracking sensitive data handling
