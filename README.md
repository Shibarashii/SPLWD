## 📋 Project Description

The **SPLWD (Student Profiling for Learners with Disabilities) System Upgrade** is a comprehensive modernization of an existing web-based student profiling system. This upgraded system serves the Sta. Cruz District of Laguna, specifically designed to digitize and centralize the management of LWD (Learners with Disabilities) student records, replacing traditional paper-based filing systems that are vulnerable to natural disasters.

The system provides a secure, role-based platform for managing student profiles, educational documents, progress tracking, and parent engagement across multiple elementary schools in the district.
